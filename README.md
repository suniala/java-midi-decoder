# Java Midi Decoder

A work in progress... Basically I copied a Midi debugger of sorts called
[DumpReceiver](https://github.com/suniala/java-midi-decoder/commit/73390f23) and
am currently refactoring it into a more useful decoder library.

I don't have the means or time to test this comprehensively so there probably
are some errors. Also, some pieces of data are not as structured as they could
be.
